Nigel Warburton brings philosophy to life with an imaginative selection of philosophical writings on key topics. Philosophy: Basic Readings is the ideal introduction to some of the most accessible and thought-provoking pieces in philosophy, both contemporary and classic.
The second edition of Philosophy: Basic Readings has been expanded to include new pieces in each major area of philosophy:
- What is philosophy?
- God
- Right and wrong
- The external world
- Science
- Mind
- Art
The readings in Philosophy: Basic Readings complement the chapters in Philosophy: The Basics (4th edition 2004).
