A richly diverse compilation of essays by the colorful New Yorker writer encompasses the themes of food, politics, sports, and the press as he speaks out on the restaurants of New York's Latin Quarter, the beachhead of Normandy, the boxing gyms in Times Square, the shadowy refuges of Southern politicians, and the trackside haunts of bookmakers. 35,000 first printing.
