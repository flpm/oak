Immerse yourself in the fantastic world of Dungeons & Dragons! This collection introduces young fans to some of the exciting characters, locations, creatures, and magical elements useful for creating your own epic, adventure-filled D&D tales.
Monsters & Creatures shines its torchlight on the beasts that haunt, hunt, and horrify adventurers—from deep underground caverns to wild forests, rocky mountains, and the soaring skies above.
