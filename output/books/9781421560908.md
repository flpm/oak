In the mid-1990s, filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki moved from success to success as his work found an audience outside of Japan. His animated films of the era, including Princess Mononoke, Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle, and Ponyo, were internationally lauded, and Miyazaki won an Academy Award&#174; in 2003 for his popular and critical hit Spirited Away.
Follow Miyazaki as his vision matures, as cinema-lovers worldwide embrace his creations, and as critics such as Roger Ebert take up the cause of animation and Miyazaki&#8217;s films. In a legendary career, these crucial years represent the turning point.
