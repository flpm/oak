The stunning graphic novels that inspired the movie Snowpiercer, directed by Oscar-winning director Bong Joon Ho, starring Chris Evans, and TNT/Netflix TV Series, starring Jennifer Connelly - collected together in a deluxe box-set in English for the very first time!
On a future, frozen Earth, a train that never stops circumnavigates the globe. On board: all of humanity that we could save from the great disaster that wrapped the planet in ice. At the front of the train, the survivors live in comfort and luxury - at the rear, their lives are worse than cattle, trapped in the squalid dark. When one of the occupants of the tail breaks through into the main train - all hell follows in his wake!
Includes 3 unique, collectable art cards!
Collects the 3 original Snowpiercer graphic novels: The Escape,The Explorers, and Terminus.
