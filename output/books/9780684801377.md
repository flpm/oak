This history of D-Day reveals the story of brave citizen soldiers;junior officers and enlisted men;who took the initiative to act on their own to penetrate Hitler's Atlantic Wall when they realized than nothing was as they were told it would be. A brilliant retelling of the battles of Omaha and Utah beaches, based on information only now available from interviews with surviving veterans, government archives, and other sources.
