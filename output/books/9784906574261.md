This book is a lucid exposition of the basic principles of Kajiwara's go theory and a guide to applying these principles in your own game. Above all else, Kajiwara emphasizes the importance of careful analysis in order to determine the correct direction of play, that is, the direction in which a stone or a group of stones exerts its main influence. He demonstrates that each stone has a life of its own and so expresses the individuality of the player. The key to a powerful game is understanding the relationship between each stone and the overall position, for only then can one realize the full potential of every stone that one plays.
