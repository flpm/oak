Vita Nostra: Subsidia ad Colloquia Latina, volume I (Latin-English) is a graded manual for developing Latin conversational skills and can be used in concert with any introductory Latin grammar text. Thematized chapters contain a dialog based on modern daily life, questions on the dialog, conversation-starting activities, encyclopedic lists of vocabulary relevant to the chapter's theme, and a special section on idioms and proverbs. Although Vita Nostra was originally developed for use in college courses and spoken-Latin seminars for the general public, many middle- and high-school teachers currently use Vita Nostra as a valuable resource. Already experienced Latinists can jump-start their speaking skills with Vita Nostra.
