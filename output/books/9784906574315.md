This book is written for players who have acquired an understanding of the
rules of go and some of its most elementary tactics and strategies by having read
an introductory book and having played a few games. We have assumed that the
reader understands the terms 'sente' and 'gote', that he knows what a ko is, is
able to determine neutral points, and can count the score. Its aim is to give the
novice an introduction to each phase of the game and to dispel a number of strategic
and tactical misconceptions that often plague beginners and inhibit their
progress.
Beginners usually overemphasize defense, not realizing that the best way to
defend is to attack. By attacking your opponent's stones, you can often defend
your weak positions in the process. Understanding this concept from the very beginning
of one's go career will clear the way for quick progress up through the
kyu ranks. In this context, Chapters Two and Four are the most important and
should be of value, especially to players who have been struggling for years to
reach expert or dan level.
