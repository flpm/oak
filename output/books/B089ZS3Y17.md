Imagine yourself in Cape Cod in early fall with the steady swells of the waves falling against the sand and the gentle rhythmic chirp of crickets in the dunes.
Unlike canned nature sounds created in a studio, renowned acoustic ecologist Gordon Hempton gives you the real deal. He travels the world recording remarkable locations that capture the essence of the place itself. His lifelong mission is to preserve nature through sound, and his soundscapes are produced with such care and quality that you feel as if he has truly brought a slice of the world into your home.
