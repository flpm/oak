Graded Go Problems for Beginners are the ideal book for players who have just learned the rules of Go, bridging the gap between a beginner's book and some of the more 'advanced' elementary books.
The almost 1,500 problems these four volumes contain thoroughly drill the reader in the fundamentals of the game. Once he has finished studying these four books he will have mastered the elements of capturing and defending stones, life and death of groups, elementary tactics, the opening and the endgame, ths laying a solid foundation for his future progress in the game.
