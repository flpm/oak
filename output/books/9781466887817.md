Mole lives alone deep underground until one fine day he dares to go up. He is shy and afraid of water, but he soon meets a friendly Water Rat who composes a poem as the story progresses. Will Mole run away or face his fears? This reader is the perfect introduction to Kenneth Grahame's classic The Wind in the Willows, with illustrations by Michael Hague.
