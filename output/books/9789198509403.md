When Terentia's father dies, he leaves her the only thing he has left - a dagger and the words "It will lead you to ...". Alone in Rome, Terentia goes out to find the secret behind her father's dagger. But she is not the only one, and soon she is fighting for the dagger, its secrets, and her own future.
When we read a novel in our own language we expect to be kept turning the page from start to finish. For Latin students such books are hard to come by. This book aims to fill this gap, offering students an exciting full-length story (ca. 70 pages) in classical Latin using only 350 unique words.
Thanks to the relatively small number of unique words, the illustrations and full vocabulary, Pugio Bruti may be read by a wide range of learners.
It is intended to be a stepping stone for students at the outset of their journey towards the ultimate goal of reading Latin from the classical period and beyond.
