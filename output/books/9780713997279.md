'Mesmerizing' Time
An art expert instantly spots a fake. A cop decides whether to shoot. A psychologist accurately predicts a couple's future in minutes. This book is about those moments when we 'know' something without knowing why. It shows that honing your instincts could change the way you think about thinking forever.
'Trust my snap judgement, buy this book: you'll be delighted' David Brooks, The New York Times

'Provocative, fascinating, radical' Fergal Byrne, Financial Times
