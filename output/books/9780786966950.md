The perfect tool to help Dungeon Masters manage EPIC fights with legendary monsters.
These 77 durable, double-sized, laminated cards represent every legendary monster found in the D&D Monster Manual, Volo’s Guide to Monsters, and Mordenkainen’s Tome of Foes. From a lich's armor class to unicorn's horn attack, monster cards let DMs select, organize, and access the information they need to help keep encounters running smoothly, without flipping through the books.
• All 77 cards have up-to-date game statistics on one side, and 73 of them include evocative art to help to bring battles to life without revealing the legendary monster's rules text.
• An evergreen accessory useful for all fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons tabletop gameplay.
• An invaluable resource for EVERY Dungeon Master.
