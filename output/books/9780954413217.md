Keep people at the center of your work! Ask them how to help. Look at what they do. Learn from the facts you gather. Try it yourself! Ideo has become a leader in design by keeping people at the center of the design process. These cards show some of the methods we use to inspire great design. Each card describes one method and includes a brief story about how and when to use it. This is not a "how to" guide. It's a design tool meant to help you explore new approaches and develop your own. Use the deck to take a new view, to inspire creativity, to communicate with your team, or to turn a corner.
