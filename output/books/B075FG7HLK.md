In Joel's Schwartzberg's 10-plus years as a strategic communications trainer, the biggest obstacle he's come across - one that connects directly to nervousness, stammering, rambling, and epic fail - is that most speakers and writers don't have a point. They typically have just a title, a theme, a topic, an idea, an assertion, a catchphrase, or even something much less.
A point is something more. It's a contention you can propose, argue, defend, illustrate, and prove. A point offers a position of potential value. "Global warming is real" is not a point. "Scientific evidence shows that global warming is a real, human-generated problem that will have a devastating environmental and financial impact" is a point. When we have a point, our influence snaps into place. We communicate belief, conviction, and urgency. This book shows you how to identify your point, leverage it, stick to it, and sell it and how to train others to identify and successfully make their own points.
