A pragmatic philosophy more popular than ever - here are 52 ancient lessons to help you overcome adversity and find tranquility in the modern world.
An ancient belief system made new, Stoicism teaches us how to accept the things we cannot change and how to live a good life. It helps us improve our outlook, increase our well-being, and thrive in the face of adversity. But how does one live like a Stoic?
In A Handbook for New Stoics, renowned philosopher Massimo Pigliucci and practitioner Gregory Lopez guide listeners through 52 weekly lessons, each based on a common obstacle. Stressing out about a meeting at work? Try listing the things you can control and those you can’t. Epictetus writes: “In our power are thought, impulse, will to get, and will to avoid” - in other words, our own attitudes. Discover what you can control and quickly achieve peace of mind.
Featuring quotes from philosophers, analysis by the authors, and journaling activities, these lessons enable listeners to reframe their perceptions and be happier.
