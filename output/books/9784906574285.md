Many Go books promise to explains the fundamentals; here is one that really keeps its promise. Kageyama's subjects are connectivity, good and bad shape, the way stones should 'move', the difference between territory and spheres of influence, how to use thickness and walls, how to train yourself to read, where to start looking in a life-and-death problem - matters so fundamental that other writers miss them completely. He also points out the right way to study - how to study joseki, for example. 'What changed me from an amateur into a professional was getting a really firm grip on the fundamentals,' writes Kageyama. The essence of seven years of amateur and twenty-two years of professional playing experience are distilled into these pages, and they are filled with advice that everyone will find practical.
