Get ready for some serious science fun when the Friz takes the kids on an explosive journey into the heart of a volcano!
Hi, I'm Dorothy Ann, one of the kids in Ms. Frizzle's class. When we started learning about volcanoes, I thought we'd just be studying them in books -- but Ms. Frizzle had other ideas. She took us all the way to Hawaii, where we waded through lava and saw a real volcano blow its top. We had a great time -- even though the trip was sometimes almost too hot to handle! One thing's for sure: This was one explosive adventure that none of us will ever forget!
