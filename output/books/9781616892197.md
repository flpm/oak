Manuel Lima's smash hit Visual Complexity is now available in paperback. This groundbreaking 2011 book—the first to combine a thorough history of information visualization with a detailed look at today's most innovative applications—clearly illustrates why making meaningful connections inside complex data networks has emerged as one of the biggest challenges in twenty-first-century design. From diagramming networks of friends on Facebook to depicting interactions among proteins in a human cell, Visual Complexity presents one hundred of the most interesting examples of informationvisualization by the field's leading practitioners.
