A special 10th-anniversary edition of Roy Peter Clark's best-selling guide to writing, featuring five bonus tools.
Ten years ago, Roy Peter Clark, America's most influential writing teacher, whittled down almost 30 years of experience in journalism, writing, and teaching into a series of 50 short essays on different aspects of writing. In the past decade, Writing Tools has become a classic guidebook for novices and experts alike and remains one of the best loved books on writing available.
Organized into four sections, "Nuts and Bolts", "Special Effects", "Blueprints for Stories", and "Useful Habits", Writing Tools is infused with more than 200 examples from journalism and literature. This new edition includes five brand-new, never-before-shared tools.
Accessible, entertaining, inspiring, and, above all, useful for every type of writer, from high school student to novelist, Writing Tools is an essential book.
PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.
