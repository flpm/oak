This book is famous for ladder problems and their solutions one of which is illustrated on the cover. Here the author creates fantastic designs in the form of go problems and their solutions. An example of one of them is on the cover. There are many more inside. He created so many of these problems, puzzles and designs that with every reprinting of this book he would take out the old ones and put in new ones instead. This possibly creates a problem as we cannot be sure which ones to include. Nakayama Noriyuki ( ) was a professional 6 dan go player. He was born September 3, 1932. He lived in Kamogawa City in Chiba Prefecture, Japan. He was author, reporter and go writer. He wrote over 30 go books. He is best known for this book which has gone through four printings already in English, German and Japanese. He also ghost wrote books for top professionals."
