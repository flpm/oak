# Oak (my personal library catalog utility knife tool)
A typer CLI tool I built to help me manage my personal library catalog (available on my personal website here: [https://flpm.dev/books](https://flpm.dev/books)).

I use this tool to parse, process and add new book data to my personal library catalog. Data come mainly from three sources, the export files from the Bookshelf IPhone app, my Audible listening history, and my Amazon purchase history.

## Stats

Oak can summarize the content of the library and display books in a timeline based on purchase time.

## Edit mode

Oak also helps me investigate issues with parsing by showing me the book details and allows me to quickly navigate the catalog.
