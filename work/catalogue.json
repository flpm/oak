It provides a detailed introduction to concepts such as emergence, self-organized criticality, automata, networks, diversity, adaptation, and feedback. It also demonstrates how complex adaptive systems can be explored using methods ranging from mathematics to computational models of adaptive agents. John Miller and Scott Page show how to combine ideas from economics, political science, biology, physics, and computer science to illuminate topics in organization, adaptation, decentralization, and robustness.

With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.\nThis major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression & path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering.

The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.\nProbabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques.

The ultimate goal is to call into question many standard tenets and lay the philosophical and probabilistic groundwork and infrastructure for statistical modeling. It is the first book devoted to the philosophy of data aimed at working scientists and calls for a new consideration in the practice of probability and statistics to eliminate what has been referred to as the \"Cult of Statistical Significance.\" The book explains the philosophy of these ideas and not the mathematics, though there are a handful of mathematical examples. The topics are logically laid out, starting with basic philosophy as related to probability, statistics, and science, and stepping through the key probabilistic ideas and concepts, and ending with statistical models. Its jargon-free approach asserts that standard methods, such as out-of-the-box regression, cannot help in discovering cause. This new way of looking at uncertainty ties together disparate fields \u2014 probability, physics, biology, the \u201csoft\u201d sciences, computer science \u2014 because each aims at discovering cause (of effects).

With the creation of clean visual concepts, designers sought to move away from the mystique they identified with the commercial artist, and to counterbalance an increasingly complicated world with clarity.This unprecedented TASCHEN publication, authored byJens Muller, brings together approximately 6,000 trademarks, focused on the period 1940 1980, to examine howmodernist attitudes and imperatives gave birth to corporate identity. Ranging from media outfits to retail giants, airlines to art galleries, the sweeping survey is organized into three design-orientated chapters: Geometric, Effect, and Typographic. Each chapter is then sub-divided into form and style led sections such as alphabet, overlay, dots and squares.Alongside the comprehensive catalog, the book features an introduction fromJens Mulleron the history of logos, and an essay byR.

This book, more than any other we know, traces the steps that went into that revolution and simultaneously makes the argument that the letter forms themselves are in process of evolution. Tracy argues that, whether they are of the sixteenth or the twentieth century, the forms that comprise our alphabet are subject to the same rules of good taste, proportion, and clarity that have always obtained. But what we face today is vastly different from fifty years ago. For the first time, new technology has made the proliferation (and, as some would maintain, debasement) of letter forms fast and easy (or quick and dirty.) With fifty years of professional experience on both sides of the Atlantic (including thirty years as head of type design for the British Linotype Company), Tracy is in a unique position to make this argument and arrive at his sad conclusion: the design of distinguished, contemporary typefaces is far outnumbered by the mediocre and downright bad. Part of the reason for this deplorable deterioration is a lack of critical analysis of the particular esthetics involved.

Understanding through seeing only seems to be an obviously intuitive process.

For years, the signs in the New York City subway system were a bewildering hodge-podge of lettering styles, sizes, shapes, materials, colors, and messages. The original mosaics (dating from as early as 1904), displaying a variety of serif and sans serif letters and decorative elements, were supplemented by signs in terracotta and cut stone. Over the years, enamel signs identifying stations and warning riders not to spit, smoke, or cross the tracks were added to the mix. Efforts to untangle this visual mess began in the mid-1960s, when the city transit authority hired the design firm Unimark International to create a clear and consistent sign system. We can see the results today in the white-on-black signs throughout the subway system, displaying station names, directions, and instructions in crisp Helvetica. This book tells the story of how typographic order triumphed over chaos. The process didn't go smoothly or quickly. At one point New York Times architecture writer Paul Goldberger declared that the signs were so confusing one almost wished that they weren't there at all. Legend has it that Helvetica came in and vanquished the competition. Paul Shaw shows that it didn't happen that way\u2014that, in fact, for various reasons (expense, the limitations of the transit authority sign shop), the typeface overhaul of the 1960s began not with Helvetica but with its forebear...", "full_title": "Helvetica and the New York City Subway System: The True (Maybe) Story", "type": "book", "cover_filename": "9780262015486.webp", "order": null, "read_status": null, "theme": "typography", "recommendation_status": null}}, "9781616890582": {"book": {"source": "Bookshelf", "owned": true, "book_id": "9781616890582", "isbn": "9781616890582", "title": "Cartographies of Time", "subtitle": null, "language": ["English"], "topics": ["Art History", "Industrial / Commercial Art & Design", "Graphic Design"], "authors": ["Daniel Rosenberg", "Anthony Grafton"], "publisher": "Princeton Architectural Pr", "length": "272 pages", "date_published": "2012-04-01", "format": "Paperback", "description": "Now in Paperback!

On a narrow plain near the Southern Italian town of Cannae, despite outnumbering their opponents almost two to one, a massive Roman army was crushed by the heterogeneous forces of Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who had spectacularly crossed the Alps into Italy two years earlier. The scale of the losses at Cannae -- 50,000 Roman men killed -- was unrivaled until the industrialized slaughter of the First World War. Although the Romans eventually recovered and Carthage lost the war, the Battle of Cannae became Romans' point of reference for all later military catastrophes. Ever since, military commanders confronting a superior force have attempted, and usually failed, to reproduce Hannibal's tactics and their overwhelming success.In Cannae, the celebrated historian Adrian Goldsworthy offers a concise and enthralling history of one of the most famous battles ever waged, setting Cannae within the larger contexts of the Second Punic War and the nature of warfare in the third century BC.

Catullus's poetry is by turns ribald, lyric, romantic, satirical; sometimes obscene and always intelligent, it offers us vivid pictures of the poet's friends, enemies, and lovers. The verses to his friends are bitchy, funny, and affectionate; those to his enemies are often wonderfully nasty.

Cicero later claimed she poisoned her husband.\nThis new bilingual translation of Catullus's surviving poems by Peter Green is fresh, bawdy, and utterly engaging. Unlike its predecessors, it adheres to the principle that the rhythm of a poem, whether familiar or not, is among the most crucial elements for its full appreciation.

Although references to shape are made in most books, there is no one book devoted exclusively to this subject. However, understanding and recognizing good shape is important for becoming a strong player and developing intuition that will instantly guide you to find the strongest moves in the opening and the middle-game fighting. Shapes are the building blocks of your groups. They determine whether your stones are working together efficiently or are sitting in each other's way. Good shape is a source of strength to build on, while bad shape often comes back to haunt you. There are two aspects of shape. One is to make good shape for your own stones; the other is to spoil the shape of your opponent's stones.

Without having mastered the art of presentation or \u201cshowmanship,\u201d however, even the most competent sleight-of-hand artist can fall short in performance.

There are two parts to Relentless. Part One is the core of the book and examines, in unprecedented detail, the 10 game match (jubango) played by Lee Sedol and Gu Li throughout 2014. Part Two reviews every other official game between the two masters (up until the end of 2015), providing the reader with ample material to review and enjoy, while reflecting on what they learned in Part One. Rather than just saying what happened, we use the match as the basis for an extensive study of the fundamental techniques, strategies and principles of Go--all applied within the context of real games, so that the reader can see how ideas and techniques are employed in practice. Go is an art form, and like other arts, studying the work of masters contributes greatly to one's appreciation, enjoyment and gradual mastery of the craft. When you study a piece of music, the goal is rarely (if ever) just to be able to play it. Rather, a deep study of a piece is intended to convey a visceral understanding of the technique and theory embodied within it, in a way that a book about theory never could.

But it's actually remarkably common - we all know what it's like to cringe in embarrassment, stand tongue-tied at the fringe of an unfamiliar group, or flush with humiliation if we suddenly become the unwelcome centre of attention.\nIn Shrinking Violets, Joe Moran explores the hidden world of shyness, providing insights on everything from timidity in lemon sharks to the role of texting in Finnish love affairs. As he seeks answers to the questions that shyness poses - Why are we shy? Can we overcome it? Does it define us? - he uncovers the fascinating stories of the men and women who were 'of the violet persuasion', from Charles Darwin to Agatha Christie, and from Tove Jansson to Nick Drake.\nIn their stories - often both heart-breaking and inspiring - and through the myriad ways scientists and thinkers have tried to explain and cure shyness, Moran finds a hopeful conclusion. To be shy, he decides, is not simply a burden - it is also a gift, a different way of seeing the world that can be both enriching and inspiring.", "purchase_date": "2023-10-07", "full_title": "Shrinking Violets: A Field Guide to Shyness", "type": "book", "cover_filename": "9781781252635.jpg", "order": null, "read_status": null, "recommendation_status": null, "theme": "psychology", "location": "New York", "signed": true, "signature_details": "the author"}}, "9781631402241": {"book": {"source": "Bookshelf", "owned": true, "book_id": "9781631402241", "isbn": "9781631402241", "title": "Locke & Key Master Edition Volume 1", "subtitle": null, "language": ["English"], "topics": ["Graphic Novels & Manga", "Horror", "Crime & Mystery"], "authors": ["Joe Hill"], "publisher": "IDW Publishing", "length": "328 pages", "date_published": "2015-06-02", "format": "Hardcover", "description": "Now a Netflix Original Series!Named a \"modern masterpiece\" by The A.V.

Readers are introduced to every aspect of the legal system, from constitutional law and the litigation process to tort law, contract law, property law, and criminal law. Feinman illuminates each discussion with many intriguing, outrageous, and infamous cases, from the scalding coffee case that cost McDonald's half a million dollars, to the sensational murder trial in Victorian London that led to the legal definition of insanity, to the epochal decision in Marbury v. Madison that gave the Supreme Court the power to declare state and federal laws unconstitutional. He broadens the reader's legal vocabulary, clarifying the meaning of everything from \"due process\" and \"equal protection\" in constitutional law, to the distinction between \"murder\" and \"manslaughter\" in criminal law.

If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards. In the first half of Clear and Simple, the authors introduce a range of styles--reflexive, practical, plain, contemplative, romantic, prophetic, and others--contrasting them to classic style. Its principles are simple: The writer adopts the pose that the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader is an intellectual equal, and the occasion is informal.

In the 21st century, they have become the most important problems we need to solve \u2014 again. Our global society has become so large and complex that our traditional trust mechanisms no longer work.\nBruce Schneier, world-renowned for his level-headed thinking on security and technology, tackles this complex subject head-on. Society can't function without trust, and yet must function even when people are untrustworthy.\nLiars and Outliers reaches across academic disciplines to develop an understanding of trust, cooperation, and social stability. From the subtle social cues we use to recognize trustworthy people to the laws that punish the noncompliant, from the way our brains reward our honesty to the bank vaults that keep out the dishonest, keeping people cooperative is a delicate balance of rewards and punishments. It's a series of evolutionary tricks, social pressures, legal mechanisms, and physical barriers.\nIn the absence of personal relationships, we have no choice but to substitute security for trust, compliance for trustworthiness. This progression has enabled society to scale to unprecedented complexity, but has also permitted massive global failures.\nAt the same time, too much cooperation is bad.

Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset. In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities. People with a fixed mindset\u2014those who believe that abilities are fixed\u2014are less likely to flourish than those with a growth mindset\u2014those who believe that abilities can be developed. Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster outstanding accomplishment.\nIn this edition, Dweck offers new insights into her now famous and broadly embraced concept. She introduces a phenomenon she calls false growth mindset and guides people toward adopting a deeper, truer growth mindset. She also expands the mindset concept beyond the individual, applying it to the cultures of groups and organizations. With the right mindset, you can motivate those you lead, teach, and love\u2014to transform their lives and your own.\nPraise for Mindset\n\u201cA good book is one whose advice you believe.

But what if these beings were more than merely fictions? What if monstrous creatures once roamed the earth in the very places where their legends first arose? This is the arresting and original thesis that Adrienne Mayor explores in The First Fossil Hunters. Through careful research and meticulous documentation, she convincingly shows that many of the giants and monsters of myth did have a basis in fact--in the enormous bones of long-extinct species that were once abundant in the lands of the Greeks and Romans.\nAs Mayor shows, the Greeks and Romans were well aware that a different breed of creatures once inhabited their lands. They frequently encountered the fossilized bones of these primeval beings, and they developed sophisticated concepts to explain the fossil evidence, concepts that were expressed in mythological stories.

cutting-edge products and services, reveals its secrets for fostering a culture and process of continuous innovation.\nThere isn't a business in America that doesn't want to be more creative in its thinking, products, and processes. At many companies, being first with a concept and first to market are critical just to survive. In The Art of Innovation, Tom Kelley, general manager of the Silicon Valley based design firm IDEO, takes listeners behind the scenes of this wildly imaginative and energized company to reveal the strategies and secrets it uses to turn out hit after hit.\nIDEO doesn't buy into the myth of the lone genius working away in isolation, waiting for great ideas to strike. Kelley believes everyone can be creative, and the goal at his firm is to tap into that wellspring of creativity in order to make innovation a way of life. How does it do that? IDEO fosters an atmosphere conducive to freely expressing ideas, breaking the rules, and freeing people to design their own work environments. IDEO's focus on teamwork generates countless breakthroughs, fueled by the constant give-and-take among people ready to share ideas and reap the benefits of the group process. IDEO has created an intense, quick-turnaround, brainstorm-and-build process dubbed \"the Deep Dive.\"\nIn entertaining anecdotes, Kelley illustrates some of his firm's own successes (and joyful failures), as well as pioneering efforts at other leading companies. The book reveals how teams research and immerse themselves in every possible aspect of a new product or service, examining it from the perspective of clients, consumers, and other critical audiences.\nKelley takes the listener through the IDEO problem-solving method:\nCarefully observing the behavior or \"anthropology\" of the people who will be using a product or service  Brainstorming with high-energy sessions focused on tangible results  Quickly prototyping ideas and designs at every step of the way  Cross-pollinating to find solutions from other fields  Taking risks, and failing your way to success  Building a \"Greenhouse\" for innovation\nIDEO has won more awards in the last ten years than any other firm of its kind, and a full half-hour Nightline presentation of its creative process received one of the show's highest ratings.

Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman's seminal studies in behavioral psychology, behavioral economics, and happiness studies have influenced numerous other authors, including Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell. In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Kahneman at last offers his own, first book for the general public. It is a lucid and enlightening summary of his life's work. It will change the way you think about thinking.\nTwo systems drive the way we think and make choices, Kahneman explains: System One is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System Two is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Examining how both systems function within the mind, Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities as well as the biases of fast thinking and the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and our choices. Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, he shows where we can trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking, contrasting the two-system view of the mind with the standard model of the rational economic agent.\nKahneman's singularly influential work has transformed cognitive psychology and launched the new fields of behavioral economics and happiness studies. In this path-breaking book, Kahneman shows how the mind works, and offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and personal lives - and how we can guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble.\nPLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.", "authors": ["Daniel Kahneman"], "narrators": ["Patrick Egan"], "publisher": "Random House Audio", "date_published": "2011-10-25", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.450290560703628, "count": 19101}, "duration": "PT20H2M", "cover_filename": "B005TKKCWC.jpg"}}, "B01N060ID9": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People", "asin": "B01N060ID9", "length": "192261", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B01N060ID9", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People", "subtitle": null, "format": "Audiobook", "listening": {"duration": 127.0, "first_time": "2021-06-28", "last_time": "2021-06-28"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B01N060ID9", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2021-06-28", "topics": ["Sales & Selling", "Communication & Social Skills", "Self-Esteem", "Relationships"], "description": "Taking a brass tacks approach to communication, How to Have Confidence and Power in Dealing with People explains how to interact with others as they really are, not as you would like them to be.

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get a proven system that can take you to new heights.\nClear is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible. Along the way, listeners will be inspired and entertained with true stories from Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.\nLearn how to:\nMake time for new habits (even when life gets crazy) Overcome a lack of motivation and willpower Design your environment to make success easier Get back on track when you fall off course And much more Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits - whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.", "authors": ["James Clear"], "narrators": ["James Clear"], "publisher": "Penguin Audio", "date_published": "2018-10-16", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.826905906862361, "count": 127682}, "duration": "PT5H35M", "cover_filename": "1524779261.jpg"}}, "B007C64916": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business", "asin": "B007C64916", "length": "269662", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B007C64916", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "The Power of Habit", "subtitle": "Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business", "format": "Audiobook", "listening": {"duration": 270.0, "first_time": "2021-07-31", "last_time": "2021-07-31"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B007C64916", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2021-07-31", "topics": ["Personal Success", "Self Development", "House Hacking"], "description": "NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER \u2022 This instant classic explores how we can change our lives by changing our habits.\nNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Wall Street Journal \u2022 Financial Times\nIn The Power of Habit, award-winning business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed.

But what if the exhaustion of constant busyness wasn't mandatory? What if you could step off the hamster wheel and start taking control of your time and attention? That's what this book is about.  As creators of Google Ventures' renowned \"design sprint,\" Jake and John have helped hundreds of teams solve important problems by changing how they work. Building on the success of these sprints and their experience designing ubiquitous tech products from Gmail to YouTube, they spent years experimenting with their own habits and routines, looking for ways to help people optimize their energy, focus, and time. Now they've packaged the most effective tactics into a four-step daily framework that anyone can use to systematically design their days. Make Time is not a one-size-fits-all formula. Instead, it offers a customizable menu of bite-size tips and strategies that can be tailored to individual habits and lifestyles.\nMake Time isn't about productivity, or checking off more to-dos. Nor does it propose unrealistic solutions like throwing out your smartphone or swearing off social media. Making time isn't about radically overhauling your lifestyle; it's about making small shifts in your environment to liberate yourself from constant busyness and distraction.  A must-listen for anyone who has ever thought, \"If only there were more hours in the day...\" Make Time will help you stop passively reacting to the demands of the modern world and start intentionally making time for the things that matter.", "authors": ["Jake Knapp", "John Zeratsky"], "narrators": ["Jake Knapp", "John Zeratsky"], "publisher": "Random House Audio", "date_published": "2018-09-25", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.541699761715647, "count": 1259}, "duration": "PT4H58M", "cover_filename": "B07DHSQL6Q.jpg", "read_status": null, "theme": "business", "recommendation_status": null}}, "1977386865": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think", "asin": "1977386865", "length": "302236", "owned": "true", "book_id": "1977386865", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think", "subtitle": null, "format": "Audiobook", "listening": {"duration": 303.0, "first_time": "2021-08-06", "last_time": "2021-08-06"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/1977386865", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2021-08-06", "topics": ["Psychology", "Philosophy", "Personal Success", "College Essays"], "description": "Over the past few years, Brianna Wiest has gained renown for her deeply moving, philosophical writing.

He's intimately familiar with the route, from its topography to its emotional touchstones - each mile nearly etched into his psyche. The starting point, nestled in the Laurentian Mountains, is an hour northeast of Montreal and home to a large part of his fabled upbringing, with its rich maternal lineage and musical legacy. It's also loaded with some good ol' fashioned baggage. The end point, New York, like for so many before and after him, serves as a storied stomping ground for his rise as an artist and person, independent of his family. It's an ever-alluring but uneasy place, as it's dished out equal measures of validation and indifference throughout their testy relationship.\nIn Road Trip Elegies, Rufus sets out on the trek with his usual personal effects: a treasure trove of memories, a razor-sharp wit, and a big appetite for healthy self-reflection. But on this particular trip, he's packed two additional items to help navigate the experience: something to record himself with and someone to talk to. For the latter, Rufus has tapped his therapist. Yes, Mark the Analyst. (Hey, why not go for the best?) What ensues over the course of three one-hour episodes is a captivating, detailed, and candid coming of age story - an artist's awakening - shared by a man who uniquely understands from whence he came and how it's all played out ever since. As satisfying or soulful a premise that may be - Rufus is the consummate showman - Road Trip Elegies offers its listeners much, much more.\nIf Elegies is anchored in Rufus' driving excavation as an artist and son (his beloved mother, Canadian folk icon Kate McGarrigle, is an essential and enduring force in his life), the title is truly lifted and made whole by its spectacular musical counterpart. Generously woven throughout the duration of the drive, each live cut (more than 20 tracks in total) is plucked from an exquisite, recent set of performances some 3,000 miles west. Captured at McCabe's Guitar Store, a music venue in Los Angeles, the three-night run was designed specifically to accompany and punctuate moments and themes derived from his Road Trip. Backed by a tight-knit four-piece band, including his sister, Lucy Wainwright Roche (vocals), and Petra Haden (vocals/violin), and featuring top-notch stage banter throughout, Rufus seamlessly moves between a sweeping breadth of songs that span generation, genre, and timbre. Many tunes were penned by his own notable family members, Kate and Anna McGarrigle, or his distinguished folk-writing father, Loudon Wainwright III; others are gorgeously Rufus-ized versions of standards from the stage, the Great American Songbook, or more modern classics. Cue: Dylan's \"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\" and Barry Gibb's always welcome \"Islands in the Stream\". Enveloped in the warmth of devoted fans and a host of admiring special attendees (Burt Bacharach, Jessica Chastain, Mike Stoller, Shirley MacLaine, Chris Guest, Darren Criss, Anjelica Huston, Jackson Browne, and Van Dyke Parks to name-drop a few), the performance, throughout, conveys a fantastic sense of both intimacy and electricity.\nBy the time Rufus approaches the city, we've been richly serenaded with beautiful melodies courtesy of the West Coast and moving stories down the state thruway. Driving solo now (don't worry, his intrepid therapist was safely dropped off in Westchester), Rufus is admittedly fully loopy: emotionally drained but highly entertaining. The final leg has the remarkably palpable vibe of just Rufus and you, working in parallel, looking to land closure. Total catharsis is of course out of reach, but Rufus' Road Trip Elegies is a bold and beautiful testament to the power of not compartmentalizing our various parts or striving to disown our past, but rather, willfully embracing the full extent of us; seeking to grasp and contain even our most challenging of pieces to arrive, more completely, at peace of mind.", "authors": ["Rufus Wainwright"], "narrators": ["Rufus Wainwright"], "publisher": "Audible Originals", "date_published": "2020-11-05", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.336890243902439, "count": 656}, "duration": "PT3H29M", "cover_filename": "B08M93Q9SP.jpg", "read_status": null, "theme": "music", "recommendation_status": null}}, "B07MDHVBLY": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "The Roman Empire: From Augustus to the Fall of Rome", "asin": "B07MDHVBLY", "length": "300", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B07MDHVBLY", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "The Roman Empire", "subtitle": "From Augustus to the Fall of Rome", "format": "Lecture", "listening": {"duration": 301.0, "first_time": "2021-11-19", "last_time": "2021-11-19"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B07MDHVBLY", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2021-11-19", "topics": ["Ancient"], "description": "When Octavian, who took the title of Augustus as the first emperor of Rome, defeated Mark Antony to become the sole ruler of the Roman world, it was a major turning point in Western civilization.

What background and training, if any, prepared them for their awesome responsibilities? What depravities did they display? And what achievements can they claim: laws passed, monuments built, lands and peoples conquered?\nDive into these questions and more with this introduction to the complex personalities of emperors such as Augustus, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. These thirty-six gripping lectures bring to life the many emperors of Rome from the turn of the 1st century to the transition to the Middle Ages. For more than five centuries, these emperors-a checkered mix of the wise, the brutal, and the unhinged-presided over a multi-ethnic empire that was nearly always at war.\nProfessor Fagan takes you deep into ancient Rome, asking: How did this system of rule come about? What did it replace? And who were the colorful, cruel, and crafty men who filled the almost omnipotent post of emperor? One of the most intriguing questions about the emperorship is why it endured for so long.\nAs you witness the reigns of the successive rulers unfold, you will see how the office evolved with the political forces that sustained it, becoming more and more tightly bound to the military. Each step toward despotism was taken with a view toward expedience. But when that step became the new normal, it paved the way for the next step, and so on. As you explore these questions, you'll also study the amalgam of eyewitness reports, later compilations, archaeological remains, and inscriptions on monuments and coins.

Professor Pigliucci, who knows firsthand just how transformative a Stoic approach to life can be, has designed these 25 lessons as an enlightening introduction to the basics of Stoic philosophy and ways to incorporate its lessons into your own life.\nFor example, the Stoic understanding of ethics was far broader than the study of right and wrong, encompassing questions concerning one\u2019s goals and one\u2019s relationship to other people. Also, the Stoics felt that logic was another requirement of a well-lived life, because good thinking helps protect us from living according to nonsensical notions.\nThroughout the course, you\u2019ll investigate what these great philosophers\u2019 words and deeds can teach us about living life in the 21st century.

He possessed great courage, ambition, honor, and vanity. Born into a noble family that had long been in decline, he advanced his career cunningly, beginning as a priest and eventually becoming Rome's leading general. He made alliances with his rivals and then discarded them when it suited him. He was a spokesman for the ordinary people of Rome, who rallied around him time and again, but he profited enormously from his conquests and lived opulently. Eventually he was murdered in one of the most famous assassinations in history.\nIn this splendid biography, Freeman presents Julius Caesar in all his dimensions and contradictions.

This definitive recording is translated with notes by Martin Hammond and an introduction by Diskin Clay. Originally written only for his personal consumption, Marcus Aurelius's Meditations has become a key text in the understanding of Roman Stoic philosophy.\nWritten in Greek by an intellectual Roman emperor without any intention of publication, the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius offer a wide range of fascinating spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the leader struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe. Spanning from doubt and despair to conviction and exaltation, they cover such diverse topics as the question of virtue, human rationality, the nature of the gods and Aurelius's own emotions. But while the Meditations were composed to provide personal consolation, in developing his beliefs Marcus also created one of the greatest of all works of philosophy: a series of wise and practical aphorisms that have been consulted and admired by statesmen, thinkers and ordinary readers for almost two thousand years.\nMartin Hammond's new translation fully expresses the intimacy and eloquence of the original work, with detailed notes elucidating the text. This edition also includes an introduction by Diskin Clay, exploring the nature and development of the Meditations. Marcus Aelius Aurelius Antoninus (121-80) was adopted by the emperor Antoninus Pius and succeeded him in 161, (as joint emperor with adoptive brother Lucius Verus). He ruled alone from 169, and spent much of his reign in putting down various rebellions, and was a persecutor of Christians. His fame rest, above all, on his Meditations, a series of reflections, strongly influenced by Epictetus, which represent a Stoic outlook on life.

Born in Yemen and raised in Ireland, Wales, and postwar England, he lost his mother at the age of six. In his teens he dropped out of university and took to the streets of London as part of a two-man escape act; when his partner went on vacation, Izzard kept busy by inventing a one-man act, and thus a career was ignited. As a stand-up comedian, Izzard has captivated audiences with his surreal, stream-of-consciousness comedy - lines such as \"cake or death?\" \"Death Star canteen\", and \"do you have a flag?\" have the status of great rock lyrics. As a self-proclaimed \"executive transvestite\", Izzard broke the mold performing in full makeup and heels and has become as famous for his advocacy for LGBT rights as he has for his art.

The point is not the often tedious claim that there is nothing new under the sun. Rather, it is to underscore the remarkable continuity of the Greek perspective and ethos preserved over several millennia. You'll learn how great literary themes that have dominated creative writing over the past two millennia were developed and bequeathed to us by a handful of ancient Greek poets and dramatists. You'll study the pure symmetry of ancient Greek art and architecture and its influence on everything from politics to the works of Leonardo da Vinci. You'll explore the Greek ideals in scholarship and the relationship the ancient Greeks saw between what you study and what you become.\nYou'll also get a chance to investigate the origins of the modern scientific method in the mathematical deductions of Pythagoras and the explosively productive inductive inquiries of Aristotle, as well as the origins of modern clinical medicine in the work of Hippocrates of Cos and the Greek writings of Galen.

Using the key metaphorical figures of the Hero and the Saint, he leads you through the history and evolution of two Western traditions that address the question of meaning: The Greek-derived, Humanist philosophical tradition and the Judeo-Christian/Islamic theistic tradition, tracking the two archetypes as they react to and evolve with cultural changes across the centuries. But these lectures go far beyond an exercise in intellectual understanding. From the very beginning, Professor Ambrosio aims the philosophical problem of meaning squarely at the student, inviting you to actively engage with it by asking you to grapple with universal questions like, How should I live my life? What is the relationship of death to life? Is there some deep, sustainable connection between the two?\nDrawing on the work of thinkers from Plato and Epictetus to Simone Weil and Viktor Frankl, you'll probe the existential choices about meaning and value that exist as potentials in the fabric of our experience and that call forth the dignity and possibility of our own living.", "authors": ["Francis J.

Using five major religions - Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism - as illustrations of how religions can address the same core issues in parallel and different ways, Professor Kimball leads you on an exploration of religion's complex and multidimensional nature. It's an exploration that can strengthen the interpersonal understanding that underlies your daily relationships, enhance your perception of events in a diverse world, and deepen your appreciation of your own beliefs and the traditions followed by others.\nUsing the basics of these five major religions as a starting point - and explaining those basics so that no prior knowledge is needed - Professor Kimball plunges deeply into each to reveal and clarify the essential structural components shared by all faiths. Among the aspects of faith you compare and contrast are creation myths and sacred stories, concepts of the divine, sacred texts and spaces, and religion's ultimate goals - the reasons its adherents give them such importance.\nAfter completing these lectures, you'll be able to \"see with a native eye\", as Professor Kimball puts it, when you wonder why followers of a given religion believe or act as they do.", "authors": ["Charles Kimball"], "narrators": ["Charles Kimball"], "publisher": "The Great Courses", "date_published": "2013-07-08", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.436893203883495, "count": 309}, "duration": "PT12H28M", "cover_filename": "B00DAGYZNO.jpg"}}, "B00DEH8UCQ": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "The Fall of the Pagans and the Origins of Medieval Christianity", "asin": "B00DEH8UCQ", "length": "299", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B00DEH8UCQ", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "The Fall of the Pagans and the Origins of Medieval Christianity", "subtitle": null, "format": "Lecture", "listening": {"duration": 26.0, "first_time": "2022-03-08", "last_time": "2022-03-08"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B00DEH8UCQ", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2022-03-08", "topics": ["Ancient", "Pagan History"], "description": "Explore the dramatic interaction between Judaism, Christianity, and paganism in Rome from the 1st to the 6th centuries.

Even after the Roman emperor Constantine converted to Christianity in A.D. 312, it would not be until the 6th-century reign of Justinian that medieval Christianity would emerge and this new historical pathway confirmed.\nIn this magnificent course, Professor Harl brings to life some of the most important and fascinating episodes of the era, taking you on a vibrant trek through the past - one that will lead you to a deeper understanding of the bedrock beliefs of Western culture.", "authors": ["Kenneth W.

The empire reached from modern-day Britain to Iraq, and gradually, emperors came not from the old families of the first century but from men born in the provinces, some of whom had never even seen Rome. By the fourth century, the time of Constantine, the Roman Empire had changed so dramatically in geography, ethnicity, religion, and culture that it would have been virtually unrecognizable to Augustus.\nIn the imperial era, Roman women - mothers, wives, mistresses - had substantial influence over the emperors, and Strauss also profiles the most important among them, from Livia, Augustus\u2019 wife, to Helena, Constantine\u2019s mother. But even women in the imperial family faced limits, and the emperors often forced them to marry or divorce for purely political reasons.\nRome\u2019s legacy remains today in so many ways, from language, law, and architecture to the seat of the Roman Catholic Church. Strauss examines this enduring heritage through the lives of the men who shaped it: Augustus, Tiberius, Nero, Vespasian, Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius, Septimius Severus, Diocletian, and Constantine. Over the ages, they learned to maintain the family business - the government of an empire - by adapting when necessary and always persevering no matter the cost.

To the contrary, religion was daily life. The many dozen gods of this ancient world were everywhere, with spirits inhabiting every crack and crevice of life. These polytheists believed they had a strict contract with their deities: If they took care of their gods, their gods would take care of them (or at least not harm them). Consequently, they built extraordinary temples to honor their deities, brought food and wine to them, sacrificed animals for them, and held sacred meals with their gods. In fact, they followed numerous rules and regulations that circumscribed almost all aspects of life both inside and outside the home - anything and everything to keep the gods happy.

Where did we come from? And what unites us in our diversity today? Anthropology and the Study of Humanity is your chance to tackle these big questions as you survey one of the world's most engaging - and human - sciences. Taught by acclaimed professor and field researcher Scott M. Lacy of Fairfield University, these 24 wide-ranging lectures are the ideal guide through the world of anthropology, or the study of humanity across time and space.\nProfessor Lacy gives you an elegant blend of theory and application to help you understand this extraordinarily interdisciplinary field as a whole. You will examine how humans evolved and built civilizations, review humanity's changing attitudes about our relationship to the cosmos, and consider the many ways we express ourselves. In the end, what you'll discover is that while our species is rich with diversity, we are all one human race.\nTo anchor this course, Professor Lacy gives you a historical overview of Homo sapiens, starting at the very root of our family tree, when proto-humans split away from other primates in the animal kingdom. As he wends his way across time and around the world, he also introduces the field's four major academic sub-disciplines: biological, archaeological, linguistic, and cultural anthropology.\nOne of the joys of this course is that it is truly global in the way Professor Lacy introduces you to the boots-on-the-ground practice of the field. When you complete this course, you will have a new appreciation for our world and its many cultures, but you will also have a new appreciation for the cultural connections and similarities we share as one race of Homo sapiens.

You'll trace his early campaigns against the Persians and follow him to Egypt, where he was acclaimed as the son of god. You'll then look at his career after this and find in him a blend of greatness and madness as he strove to replace the Persian empire of the Achaemenid dynasty with a new, mixed ruling class of Macedonians and Persians.\nFrom there, you'll delve into the catastrophic period after Alexander's death in 323 B.C., which ushered in a period of catastrophic change as ambitious warlords carved up Alexander's realm into their own separate empires. You'll learn about each of the three kingdoms that resulted: Ptolemaic Egypt, Seleucid Syria, and the Attalid Empire in Asia Minor. Just as important to these lectures are the in-depth discussions of the bounties of Hellenistic culture, which contributed landmark ideas in everything from philosophy (which became more academic), art and architecture (with its excessive, naked emotions), and religion (especially the growing popularity of cult movements).

The clash of these two great cultures helped spark some of the most important cultural events in the history of the world: the chronicles of Herodotus, Thucydides, and Xenophon; the dramas of Aeschylus; and Greece's remarkable invention of democracy.\nAn expert on methods of ancient warfare, Professor Hale offers rare insights into how each skirmish was lost and won. You'll meet the great Greek and Persian leaders, and compare the war technologies they pioneered.\nBut Professor Hale offers more than just textbook descriptions. An accomplished archaeologist, he provides rare and valuable insights gleaned from years of fieldwork, including an analysis of the landscape of the battlefield of Marathon and modern archaeological surveys of the ground where Xerxes and his engineers dug an 80-foot-wide canal across an Aegean cape.\nIt's a perspective on history you'll find virtually nowhere else.

This is an audiobook to appreciate on many levels, most of all, to hear the sound of Latin again, so familiar and so essential to the ear.\" (AudioFile Magazine)\nA lively exploration of the joys of a not-so-dead language\nFrom the acclaimed novelist and Oxford professor Nicola Gardini, a personal and passionate look at the Latin language: its history, its authors, its essential role in education, and its enduring impact on modern life - whether we call it \u201cdead\u201d or not.\nWhat use is Latin? It\u2019s a question we\u2019re often asked by those who see the language of Cicero as no more than a cumbersome heap of ruins, something to remove from the curriculum. In this sustained meditation, Gardini gives us his sincere and brilliant reply: Latin is, quite simply, the means of expression that made us - and continues to make us - who we are. In Latin, the rigorous and inventive thinker Lucretius examined the nature of our world; the poet Propertius told of love and emotion in a dizzying variety of registers; Caesar affirmed man\u2019s capacity to shape reality through reason; Virgil composed the Aeneid, without which we\u2019d see all of Western history in a different light.\nIn Long Live Latin, Gardini shares his deep love for the language - enriched by his tireless intellectual curiosity - and warmly encourages us to engage with a civilization that has never ceased to exist, because it\u2019s here with us now, whether we know it or not. Thanks to his careful guidance, even without a single lick of Latin grammar listeners can discover how this language is still capable of restoring our sense of identity, with a power that only useless things can miraculously express.", "authors": ["Nicola Gardini", "Todd Portnowitz"], "narrators": ["Todd Portnowitz"], "publisher": "Macmillan Audio", "date_published": "2019-11-12", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.650793650793651, "count": 63}, "duration": "PT8H18M", "cover_filename": "125075044X.jpg", "read_status": null, "theme": "learning latin", "recommendation_status": null}}, "B0B3BV9MC9": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "Semiotics: The Basics: The Basics", "asin": "B0B3BV9MC9", "length": "300", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B0B3BV9MC9", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "Semiotics: The Basics", "subtitle": "The Basics", "format": "Audiobook", "listening": {"duration": 600.0, "first_time": "2022-12-28", "last_time": "2023-01-22"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B0B3BV9MC9", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2022-12-28", "topics": ["Literary History & Criticism", "Social Sciences", "Communication & Social Skills"], "description": "This third edition of the bestselling textbook has been fully revised, continuing to provide a concise introduction to the key concepts of semiotics in accessible and jargon-free language.\nDemystifying what is a complex, highly interdisciplinary field, key questions covered include: What are signs and codes?

Yet how did all this emerge from what was once an insignificant village in central Italy?\nIn SPQR, world-renowned classicist Mary Beard narrates the unprecedented rise of a civilization that even 2,000 years later still shapes many of our most fundamental assumptions about power, citizenship, responsibility, political violence, empire, luxury, and beauty. From the foundational myth of Romulus and Remus to 212 CE, nearly a thousand years later, when the emperor Caracalla gave Roman citizenship to every free inhabitant of the empire, SPQR (the abbreviation of \"The Senate and People of Rome\") not just examines how we think of ancient Rome but challenges the comfortable historical perspectives that have existed for centuries by exploring how the Romans thought of themselves: how they challenged the idea of imperial rule, how they responded to terrorism and revolution, and how they invented a new idea of citizenship and nation.\nOpening the audiobook in 63 BCE with the famous clash between the populist aristocrat Catiline and Cicero, the renowned politician and orator, Beard animates this \"terrorist conspiracy\", which was aimed at the very heart of the republic, demonstrating how this singular event would presage the struggle between democracy and autocracy that would come to define much of Rome's subsequent history.

Seth employs his signature blend of insight, observation, and memorable examples to teach you:\nHow to build trust and permission with your target market.

You can be lonely anywhere, but there is a particular flavor to the loneliness that comes from living in a city, surrounded by thousands of strangers. The Lonely City is a roving cultural history of urban loneliness, centered on the ultimate city: Manhattan, that teeming island of gneiss, concrete, and glass.\nWhat does it mean to be lonely? How do we live if we're not intimately involved with another human being? How do we connect with other people, particularly if our sexuality or physical body is considered deviant or damaged? Does technology draw us closer together or trap us behind screens?\nOlivia Laing explores these questions by traveling deep into the work and lives of some of the century's most original artists, among them Andy Warhol, David Wojnarowicz, Edward Hopper, Henry Darger, and Klaus Nomi. Part memoir, part biography, part dazzling work of cultural criticism, The Lonely City is not just a map, but a celebration of the state of loneliness.

Is the English language being corrupted by texting and social media? Do the kids today even care about good writing? Why should any of us care?\nIn The Sense of Style, the best-selling linguist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker answers these questions and more. Rethinking the usage guide for the 21st century, Pinker doesn\u2019t carp about the decline of language or recycle pet peeves from the rulebooks of a century ago. Instead, he applies insights from the sciences of language and mind to the challenge of crafting clear, coherent, and stylish prose.\nIn this short, cheerful, and eminently practical book, Pinker shows how writing depends on imagination, empathy, coherence, grammatical knowhow, and an ability to savor and reverse engineer the good prose of others. He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish.\nFilled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right.\nPLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.", "authors": ["Steven Pinker"], "narrators": ["Arthur Morey"], "publisher": "Penguin Audio", "date_published": "2014-09-30", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.443254817987152, "count": 467}, "duration": "PT12H26M", "cover_filename": "B00M8U0CJ4.jpg"}}, "B00NLEVIRG": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "As You Wish: Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride", "asin": "B00NLEVIRG", "length": "299", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B00NLEVIRG", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "As You Wish", "subtitle": "Inconceivable Tales from the Making of The Princess Bride", "format": "Audiobook", "listening": {"duration": 300.0, "first_time": "2023-05-15", "last_time": "2023-05-15"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B00NLEVIRG", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2023-05-15", "topics": ["Art", "History & Criticism", "Entertainment & Celebrities", "Popular Culture"], "description": "From actor Cary Elwes, who played the iconic role of Westley in The Princess Bride, comes a first-person account and behind-the-scenes look at the making of the cult classic film filled with never-before-told stories and interviews with costars Robin Wright, Wallace Shawn, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, and Mandy Patinkin, as well as author and screenwriter William Goldman, producer Norman Lear, and director Rob Reiner.\nThe Princess Bride has been a family favorite for close to three decades.

It's the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that's a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are.\nLanguage is humanity's most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What's more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time. Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it.\nInternet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer \"LOL\" or \"lol,\" why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.", "authors": ["Gretchen McCulloch"], "narrators": ["Gretchen McCulloch"], "publisher": "Penguin Audio", "date_published": "2019-07-23", "language": ["English"], "rating": {"rating": 4.50635593220339, "count": 472}, "duration": "PT8H", "cover_filename": "0525626166.jpg"}}, "B0BCCWXT68": {"audiobook_sample": {"full_title": "Tell It Like It Is: A Guide to Clear and Honest Writing", "asin": "B0BCCWXT68", "length": "194", "owned": "true", "book_id": "B0BCCWXT68", "type": "audiobook_sample", "title": "Tell It Like It Is", "subtitle": "A Guide to Clear and Honest Writing", "format": "Audiobook", "listening": {"duration": 24.0, "first_time": "2023-05-22", "last_time": "2023-05-22"}, "link": "https://www.audible.com/pd/B0BCCWXT68", "source": "Audible", "listening_date": "2023-05-22", "topics": ["Words, Language & Grammar", "Writing & Publishing"], "description": "America's favorite writing coach returns with a guide to writing clearly and honestly in a world full of lies, propaganda, and misinformation.\nThe darker and more dystopian the future appears, the more influential public writers become.

In doing so, he provides answers to some of the most pressing questions facing writers today:  How do I make hard facts\u2014about pandemics, wars, natural disasters, social justice\u2014easy reading? How do I get readers to pay attention to what they need to know? How do I help contribute to a culture of writing that combats misinformation and propaganda?

Grammar is about much more than rules: It\u2019s about choices, too - since a thought can always be expressed correctly in multiple ways.\nIn Grammar for a Full Life, author Lawrence Weinstein reveals how our grammatical choices either stifle or boost our:\nSense of agency in life Creativity Depth of connection to others And mindfulness.. Weinstein shows that certain tweaks to a person\u2019s grammar can bring consequential changes in his or her fulfillment and well-being. In this wonderful audiobook, he describes some 40 transformative moves that can be made with English punctuation and syntax. You\u2019ll learn, for instance, why a greater use of active voice constructions builds assertive energy in us. You\u2019ll discover how - paradoxically - cutting back on the \u201cintensifiers\u201d (exclamation marks and words like really, absolutely) heightens our awareness of the world.\nThere is not too much about personality and life that Weinstein doesn\u2019t see benefitting from a wiser use of grammar. In a section titled \u201cBonding\u201d, even sex comes in for some grammatical attention. Even fear of death receives its own, almost lyrical section near book\u2019s end.\nThe farther one gets into this remarkable audiobook, the clearer it becomes that Weinstein\u2019s wish - for both himself and us - is actualization of \u201cthe whole person\u201d, through language.\nNo listener should be intimidated by Weinstein's university credentials. As important an audiobook as his is, it's conversational throughout - and it's packed with numerous compelling, clear examples. You will never think of commas or possessive pronouns in the same way again. Your regard for the conjunction \"but\" is likely to soar.\nPraise for Grammar for a Full Life has been coming in from thought leaders of all kinds, ranging from well-known authors on language, such as Anne Fadiman, Lynne Truss, and Richard Lederer, to influential spiritual thinkers, like Rabbi Lawrence Kushner.\nPlease Note: Grammar for a Full Life is not an audiobook intended for the person new to the English language.
